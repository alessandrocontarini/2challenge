1)BankAcc
  Solution
    The program change the right PIN every time you run it. Maybe there is a random function with a dynamic seed. But in this case maybe is easier patch the command jnz into jz (75->74)
    
    Please insert the OTP 4 digit pin to authenticate: 
    1234
    PIN Correct! Here your bank account:
    Flag{P00r_45_DuCk} 

2)be_quick_or_be_dead
  Remember : chmod +x be-quick-or-be-dead-1
  f5(pseuocode on IDA)
  
  ./be-quick-or-be-dead-1 
  Be Quick Or Be Dead 1
  =====================
  
  Calculating key...
  You need a faster machine. Bye bye.
  
  Solution:
    Inspect the binary_file with IDA
    There is a call to "set_timer" function. I try to deactivate this function by replacing the call with NOP (90)
    
    ./be-quick-or-be-dead-1 
    Be Quick Or Be Dead 1
    =====================
    
    Calculating key...
    Done calculating key
    Printing flag:
    picoCTF{why_bother_doing_unnecessary_computation_27f28e71}

3)Solitaire
  The goal is to obtain the same sequence of cards everytime you run the game. So an idea could be change the srand(time) to srand(const) 
  By doing this method you use a const seed, so you obtain a pseudo-random sequence of cards (that is our goal)
  Ho sentito gli assistenti; mi hanno detto che ho fatto giusto (ma il programma mi genera sempre core dumps)
