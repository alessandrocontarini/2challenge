  Solution
    The program change the right PIN every time you run it. Maybe there is a random function with a dynamic seed. But in this case maybe is easier patch the command jnz into jz (75->74)
    
    Please insert the OTP 4 digit pin to authenticate: 
    1234
    PIN Correct! Here your bank account:
    Flag{P00r_45_DuCk}
