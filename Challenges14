    ERROR! Program failed to load emails.
    Terminating
    
    =>le credenziali sono giuste ma c'Ã¨ errore. Do un'occhiata con IDA
    Potremmo mettere un breakpoint appena prima della chiamata d'errore e fare un jump alla funzione showEmails
    Siccome il main non chiama mai showEmails potremmo mettere un breakpoint al main e saltare a showEmails
    
    	b main
    	run
    	pwndbg> jump showEmails
    	Continuing at 0x56555a30.
    	You have 1 unread email.
    	1) Read Email
    	2) Quit
    	>> 1

    	Hey John it's Leeroy.
    	You were asking about a fun flag to use in your next challenge
    	and I think I got one. Tell me what you think of:
    	TUCTF{l0c4l_<_r3m073_3x3cu710n}
    	Get back to me as soon as you can. Thanks!

  Solution:
    There is a "decrypt_flag" iterative function.
    I put a breakpoint before the end of the function and inspect the contents of the registers
    b* 0x00000000004008a8
    run
    RDX: 0x6022a0 ("picoCTF{gDb_iS_sUp3r_u53fuL_f3f39814}")
