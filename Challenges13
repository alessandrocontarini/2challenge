1)BankAcc
  Solution
    The program change the right PIN every time you run it. Maybe there is a random function with a dynamic seed. But in this case maybe is easier patch the command jnz into jz (75->74)
    
    Please insert the OTP 4 digit pin to authenticate: 
    1234
    PIN Correct! Here your bank account:
    Flag{P00r_45_DuCk} 

2)be_quick_or_be_dead
  Remember : chmod +x be-quick-or-be-dead-1
  f5(pseuocode on IDA)
  
  ./be-quick-or-be-dead-1 
  Be Quick Or Be Dead 1
  =====================
  
  Calculating key...
  You need a faster machine. Bye bye.
  
  Solution:
    Inspect the binary_file with IDA
    There is a call to "set_timer" function. I try to deactivate this function by replacing the call with NOP (90)
    
    ./be-quick-or-be-dead-1 
    Be Quick Or Be Dead 1
